-E-store for who likes to wear nice things.

-TASK FOR MYSELF IN THIS PROJECT: Build a site that people can see the items and add to their cart if they want to buy. When they go to the cart page they should be able to see what is the cost of the items. They need to be able to adjust how many items that they want to buy, add more or decrease the item count if they want less of that item. Also if they change their minds, they should be able to clear all the items from the cart.
 
 -What was the practices for me in this project: I have used React Hooks such as useState, useContext and useEffect hooks , also I've used React Router v6.
